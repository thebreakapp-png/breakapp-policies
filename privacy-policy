📄 PRIVACY POLICY — BREAK
Last updated: 27/11/2025
This Privacy Policy explains how BREAK (“the App”) handles user information.
BREAK is owned and operated by Juan Pablo Cirett (“we”, “us”, or “our”).
We are committed to protecting your privacy.
This document describes what information we collect, how we use it, and your rights.
1. Information We Collect
BREAK does not collect, store, process, or transmit any personal data.
The App does not use:
Analytics
Tracking technologies
Advertising tools
Cookies
Crash reporting
User accounts or logins
Cloud storage
Device identifiers
Location services
All features operate locally on your device only.
2. Local Data Stored on Your Device
BREAK stores only non-personal preferences—for example:
Whether you completed onboarding
Whether to display timer text
Whether to display phrases
Subscription status
Session settings
This information is stored using Apple’s AppStorage and never leaves your device.
We cannot access, read, or use this information.
3. Subscriptions & Purchases
BREAK offers optional paid features through Apple’s in-app purchase system.
Apple processes all payments. We do not receive your:
Name
Email
Payment details
Location
Billing information
All billing and subscription data is handled entirely by Apple.
4. Guided Access & Device Locking
BREAK provides instructions for using iOS Guided Access, an Apple feature that restricts device use.
The App does not access your passcode.
The App does not control Guided Access.
All security and restrictions are handled by iOS.
We never collect, store, or process any Guided Access settings.
5. Children’s Privacy
The App does not collect any information from users, including children.
However, because the App may temporarily block device access, adult supervision is recommended for minors.
6. International Users
Although the developer is based in Mexico, this Privacy Policy complies with global standards, including:
GDPR (EU)
California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)
Mexico’s Federal Law on Protection of Personal Data Held by Private Parties (LFPDPPP)
Since BREAK does not collect personal data, these laws are fully satisfied.
7. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this policy periodically.
The latest version will always be available at the published link.
Your continued use of BREAK after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.
