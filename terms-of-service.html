  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
  <small>Last updated: [Insert Date]</small>

  <hr />

  <p>Welcome to <strong>BREAK</strong> (“the App”), owned and operated by <strong>Juan Pablo Cirett</strong> (“we”, “us”, or “our”). By downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service (“Terms”).</p>

  <p>If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the App.</p>

  <h2>1. Purpose of the App</h2>
  <p>BREAK helps users reduce digital distraction by:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Displaying a blank or minimal screen</li>
    <li>Encouraging intentional device-free time</li>
    <li>Providing optional guidance or reflective phrases</li>
    <li>Allowing users to set timers for focus sessions</li>
    <li>Offering instructions for using iOS Guided Access, an Apple feature that can restrict device use</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The App is intended for personal productivity, mindfulness, and focus.</p>

  <h2>2. User Responsibility</h2>
  <p>By using BREAK, you acknowledge and agree that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You decide when to start and end a session.</li>
    <li>You are solely responsible for enabling, configuring, and disabling iOS Guided Access.</li>
    <li>While a session is active, your access to other apps, calls, messages, and features may be restricted.</li>
    <li>You will not use BREAK in situations where immediate access to your phone is critical (e.g., emergencies, driving, navigation, safety-critical tasks).</li>
    <li>You are responsible for remembering or managing your Guided Access passcode.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>BREAK does not control, modify, or override Guided Access; it only provides instructions for how to use Apple’s built-in feature.</p>

  <h2>3. Safety Warning</h2>
  <p>Using BREAK may temporarily limit your ability to use your device.</p>

  <p>You should <strong>not</strong> use BREAK:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>In emergency situations or when you may need to contact emergency services</li>
    <li>When expecting urgent communication</li>
    <li>While driving or operating a vehicle</li>
    <li>While responsible for another person’s safety</li>
    <li>In any situation where limited access to your device could cause harm</li>
  </ul>

  <p>You accept full responsibility for choosing appropriate times and contexts to use the App.</p>

  <h2>4. Subscriptions &amp; Payments</h2>
  <p>BREAK may offer optional features via a <strong>monthly subscription</strong>.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Payments are processed through the Apple App Store using your Apple ID.</li>
    <li>We do not receive your payment information directly.</li>
    <li>Subscriptions may automatically renew unless you cancel at least 24 hours before the renewal date.</li>
    <li>You can manage or cancel your subscription at any time in your Apple ID account settings under <em>Subscriptions</em>.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>All billing and refund requests are subject to Apple’s policies. We do not provide refunds directly.</p>

  <h2>5. No Warranty</h2>
  <p>The App is provided on an <strong>“as is”</strong> and <strong>“as available”</strong> basis without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied.</p>

  <p>We do not warrant that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The App will always function without interruption or errors</li>
    <li>The App will meet all of your expectations or productivity goals</li>
    <li>The App will be compatible with all devices or future versions of iOS</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Your use of the App is at your sole risk.</p>

  <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, we shall not be liable for any damages, losses, or consequences arising out of or related to your use of BREAK, including but not limited to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Missed calls, messages, or notifications</li>
    <li>Inability to access emergency services while using the App</li>
    <li>Loss of access due to Guided Access settings or forgotten passcodes</li>
    <li>Any indirect, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages</li>
  </ul>

  <p>You agree to hold us harmless from any claims arising from your use or misuse of the App.</p>

  <h2>7. Changes to These Terms</h2>
  <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. When we do, we will update the “Last updated” date at the top of this page.</p>

  <p>By continuing to use BREAK after changes are posted, you agree to the updated Terms.</p>

  <h2>8. Governing Law</h2>
  <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of <strong>Mexico</strong>, without regard to its conflict of law principles. Any disputes arising from or relating to these Terms or your use of the App will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in Mexico.</p>
